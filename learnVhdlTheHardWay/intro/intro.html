    <h1>The hard way is easier</h1>
    <p>
      In this book you will learn how to program with vhdl.  Each exercise will follow this basic formula:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>go through each exercise</li>
      <li>type the code word for word</li>
      <li>make it synthesize</li>
      <li>testbench it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Thats all there really is to it. For the scope of this book.  You should spend an hour or two working on these exercies every day.
    </p>
    <h2>Reading and writing</h2>
    <p>
      You'd be surprised how many people miss a character or two and be 
      totally oblivious.  I once showed someone the printf function and 
      it boggled his mind as to why it wouldn't compile.  He was missing an f.

    <p>
      You must pay attention to how things are spelled.  Get used to typing 
      those words and they will become part of your muscle memory.  Not just
      for your hands, but for you brain as well.  The more you practice seeing
      the words, the more instant your response to them will be.
    </p>
    <h2>attention to detail</h2>
    <p>
      Sounds kind of redundant to say this but really.  Pay attention to the
      details.  They are important.  If I use a double quotes then you should
      use a double quote and not a single quote.  
    </p>
    <h2>spotting differences</h2>
    <p>
      as far as spelling is concerned.  You need to spell the words correctly.
      You don't really have to worry about capitalization in vhdl, but you
      might as well type everything as if case does matter.  Most languages
      are case sensitive, so I wouldn't want to be confused.
    </p>
    <h2>do not copy and paste</h2>
    <p>
      If you copy and pase, you might as well not continue reading this book.
      You won't learn anything by copy and pasting.  You have to type it up
      by hand.
    </p>
    <h2>A note on practice and persistence</h2>
    <p>
      I remember first starting out this language and having no clue why the
      code works this way and why it doesn't work that way.  I could google
      the answer, but it's not like I really understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      you will most likely feel that way.  It is ok.  It is normal.  Only 
      after being extracted from metal ores in the furnace and pounded into
      shape and sharpened does a slab of metal deserve the name katana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just keep it all up and one day it will click.
