		<h1>recap</h1>
		<p>
		Last time we went into making a simple one bit buffer.  This was to show you the basic codes that you will need in order to write with vhdl.  You learned about how entities are just like function declarations which just show what parameters.  You learned that we use architectures to implement the entity.
		</p>
		<h1>more parameters</h1>
		<p>
		Just like in Software programs, you can have a function with infinite number of parameters.  In this lession you will learn how to add more parameters to your buffer.  The end result is a 4 bit buffer.
