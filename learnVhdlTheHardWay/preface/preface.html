    <h1>Preface</h1>
    <p>
      This book is meant to get you started with vhdl programming.  Although the title says that this is the hard way, it really isn't.  The course is aimmed at teaching through doing.  I personally am not a fan of theory, except when I am.  So I teach the way that I learned.  Through practice practice and practice.  At first you will not understand why you are doing these things, but then one day it will all click and you will "get" it.

    <p>
      The book will instruct you on how to use vhdl with xilinx and testing it with iSim.

      I got the idea from the book <a href="learnpythonthehardway.org">learn python the hard way</a>.  I like the way it instructs you and gradually brings up the difficulty level.
