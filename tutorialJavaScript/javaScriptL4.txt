Add the following code to create a "canvas" element.  The "canvas" is an element that gives us the ability to draw basic lines and shapes.

Go ahead and run the code.

Don't worry, nothing is broken.  The canvas is just the same color as the default background.  

Add a border around the canvas to help it stand out.
